## 1. Coding Dojo preparation

### 1.1. The topic

Anything that we can teach and practice that will improve the everyday life of the engineers.

### 1.2. How ?

We use the Kata approach, which means the presenter will pose a specific challenge
to the participants and will show them how to overcome it.
Weâ€™re going to group everybody in pairs, considering the overall experience
in Software Development of each member to build the pairs.

### 1.3. The presentation

Present the project and the exercises.

Keep it short and simple, we want to keep people engaged.
Furthermore, there will be live moderators able to reply to any question during the session itself.

~ 10 minutes.

### 1.4. Exercises

Normally there is a repo in Github (eg: this repository)

**IMPORTANT**: do a trial of the session, to be sure that everything is in place.

Exercises from simpler to more difficult and prepare the exercises in a way that is not too difficult
to understand:

- no difficult trick
- no trap
- the aim is not to test participant level, it is to help them to understand the basics of a technology

Normally only 10% of people manage to complete all the exercises and this is expected.

Share the repo, and make it accessible.

in case: download the zip and share it!

### The whitepaper

The whitepaper aim is to present:

- the coding dojo concept
- the aim of this particular coding dojo instance
- the needed tools and environment

You can find here [a Whitepaper template example](/docsCodingDojoFacilitator/CodingDojoWhitePaperTemplate.md).

### 1.5. The registration form

The registration form will ideally contain [the Whitepaper template](/docsCodingDojoFacilitator/CodingDojoWhitePaperTemplate.md).

With the registration form we'll collect information about the number of participants, their experience
and their time zone.

sent to: {your mailing list}

The registration form should ideally be sent 1 month before the event.

You can use this [Registration form template](/docsCodingDojoFacilitator/CodingDojoRegistrationFormTemplate.md).

### 1.6. The invitation

Once you have collected the registrations, you can create pairs.
Ideally mix beginner level with intermediate or higher level.
Note however that most of the time, some people are not available during the session,
for different reasons (illness, ...), so be prepared to adjust the pairs at realtime.

Send the invitation for a 3.5 to 4 hours meeting, at least 2 weeks before the event.

Share the pairs within the invitation, remind them to get in touch and prepared in advance with
the tools for the session.

## 2. The sessions

Adjust sessions depending on affluence, timezone and availability of moderators.

Duration of the session: 3.5 hours.

The idea is to have one breakout for one exercise, but people can decide to continue on the same
exercise, depending on their own knowledge.

Example:
10 minutes - Presentation (keep it short to don t lose people)

40 minutes - First breakout session

5 minutes - Regroup (people do not like to be interrupted)

40 minutes - Second Breakout Session

5 minutes - Regroup

15 minutes - Coffee Break

40 minutes - Third  Breakout Session

5 minutes - Regroup

35 minutes - Fourth Breakout Session

15 minutes - Close Coding Dojo (time for questions, Say thanks and share the feedback survey)

### 2.1. The moderators/facilitators

Worst case: 1 moderator - 10 people, given we use the KATA approach, that means pear programming so
1 moderator we'll need to manage 5 rooms.

### 2.2. The secretary

For each session, we need someone that can organize the rooms and help people jumping
from one room to the other.

### The breakout rooms

Using Microsoft teams, check the documentation
[Creating breakout rooms in advance of a meeting](https://www.marquette.edu/microsoft-teams/pre-assign-breakout-rooms.php)

### 2.3. The Feedback Survey

Remember to share the feedback survey by the end of the DOJO
You can use this [Feedback survey template](/docsCodingDojoFacilitator/CodingDojoFeebackSurveyTemplate.md)
